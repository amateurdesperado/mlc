#data types
set: an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include
membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.
Set objects also support mathematical operations like union,
intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
  u can't append sets with lists, only tuples
  (TypeError: unhashable type: 'list')

#pandas
DataFrame is a data representation as a table
easy to make DataFrames from dicts:
  frame = pd.DataFrame(dict)
make DataFrame from file data:
  frame = pd.read_csv('filename.tsv', header=0, sep='\t')
  sep stands for what the data is separated buy
write DataFrame to file:
  frame.to_csv('updated_dataset.csv', sep=',', header=True, index=False)
append DataFrame:
  frame.append(newline, ignore_index)
  doesn't change the original DataFrame tho
  changes the original DataFrame:
  frame = frame.append()
delete line from DataFrame:
  frame.drop([1,5], axis = 0, inplace = True)
delete column from DataFrame:
  fr.drop(['columnname'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
